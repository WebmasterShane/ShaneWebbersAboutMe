This is a portfolio designed for my self to reflect who i am and what work i have done in the past.



## My Contribution

Using Bootstrap i created a 3 page Web Layout with a consistant and fully functioning navigation bar.
Utilzing Bootstraps grid lay out system i was able to create a completly responive layout and images.
to achieve this i use Bootstrap class tags like "container" (which creates a container for the grid) "col-md" (which creats a medium sized fluid col) "col-6" (which creates a col that takes up 6 or the 12 possible columns) "row" (which creates 1 row inside of the container) and "img-fluid" (whichs allows images to be responsive within the grid system).
I deployed semantic html elements to make the code easier to read.
for example, <section>,<nav>, and <footer>.
i also created a sticky footer for the document by ulitizing the Bootstrap classes "row" "fixed-bottom" and "text-center"
I also made all images their own link so it will bring you to a seperate page with just that image if you would like to get a close look.
To create the nav bar i used BootStrap classes such as "navbar" "navbar-expand-sm" "navbar-toggler" "navbar-toggler-icon" "collapse" "navbar-collapse" "navbar-nav" "nav-item" and "nav-link".
To create the contact for i used <input> with a "form-control" class and <textarea> and a "form-control" class to create the larger message window.
